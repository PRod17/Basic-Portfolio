 <p>I was born and raised in Chicago. Graduated North Eastern Illinois University with a degree in Economics. I was a Market Maker on the floor of the CBOE and have traded stock options for 18 years. I still love the markets and plan to stay involved going forward. However at this point I have decided to update my skill set and learn to code. Wish me luck, I am definitely going to need it.
